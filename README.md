# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts housing prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. The goal is to provide accurate price estimates using regression techniques.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Predict housing prices using historical data
- Explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation
- Implement multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE and R²


## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sprinkled-Cpu/housing-price-prediction.git
cd housing-price-prediction

🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
📌 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Incorporate geographic data (e.g., latitude/longitude)
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
